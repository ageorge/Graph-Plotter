Interfacing C++ with Microsoft Excel

This project was developed to interface data generated in a C++ application to plot on the graph. The code contains definition for Graph class.  

The constructor of the graph class takes a label for x and y axis along with the chart name

The addItem() function is called for every entity to be plotted

The display() function outputs the values plotted on the graph to the console

The functions â€“ initializeGraph() and generateGraph() are used to create a new excel workbook and draw the bar chart

In order to make the application fully functional, you will need the following resources: EXCEL.EXE, MSO.DLL, and VBE6EXT.OLB
